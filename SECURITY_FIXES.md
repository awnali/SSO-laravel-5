# Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the Single Sign-On (SSO) Laravel application.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) - CRITICAL
**Location**: `server/app/Http/Controllers/MyServerController.php`
**Issue**: Arbitrary method execution vulnerability
**Fix**: 
- Added whitelist of allowed SSO commands
- Implemented proper input validation
- Added method existence verification
- Added error handling and logging

**Before**:
```php
$command = isset($_REQUEST['command']) ? $_REQUEST['command'] : null;
$ssoServer->$command(); // DANGEROUS: Any method could be called
```

**After**:
```php
private const ALLOWED_COMMANDS = ['attach', 'login', 'logout', 'userInfo'];
$command = $request->input('command');
if (!$command || !in_array($command, self::ALLOWED_COMMANDS, true)) {
    return response()->json(['error' => 'Invalid or unknown command'], 404);
}
```

### 2. Hardcoded Secrets - HIGH
**Location**: `server/app/MySSOServer.php`
**Issue**: Broker secrets hardcoded in source code
**Fix**: 
- Moved secrets to environment variables
- Added broker ID validation
- Updated environment configuration files

**Before**:
```php
private static $brokers = [
    'broker1' => ['secret'=>'broker1_secret'],
    'broker2' => ['secret'=>'broker2_secret']
];
```

**After**:
```php
private function getBrokers() {
    return [
        'broker1' => ['secret' => env('SSO_BROKER1_SECRET')],
        'broker2' => ['secret' => env('SSO_BROKER2_SECRET')]
    ];
}
```

### 3. Information Disclosure - MEDIUM
**Location**: Multiple files with excessive logging
**Issue**: Sensitive information logged in plain text
**Fix**: 
- Removed sensitive data from logs
- Added IP-based logging for security monitoring
- Implemented secure logging practices

### 4. Missing Rate Limiting - MEDIUM
**Location**: `server/app/MySSOServer.php`
**Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks
**Fix**: 
- Added basic rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Implemented IP-based attempt tracking
- Added lockout mechanism after 5 failed attempts

### 5. Weak Input Validation - MEDIUM
**Location**: Multiple authentication methods
**Issue**: Insufficient input validation
**Fix**: 
- Added email format validation
- Implemented broker ID sanitization
- Added proper error handling

### 6. Insecure HTTP Requests - MEDIUM
**Location**: Broker implementations
**Issue**: Missing SSL verification and timeouts
**Fix**: 
- Enabled SSL certificate verification
- Added connection and request timeouts
- Improved error handling

## Environment Configuration Security

### Updated .env.example files with:
- Production-safe defaults (`APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`)
- Secure session configuration
- SSO-specific environment variables
- Security headers configuration

### Required Environment Variables:
```bash
# Server
SSO_BROKER1_SECRET=your_secure_broker1_secret_here_change_this
SSO_BROKER2_SECRET=your_secure_broker2_secret_here_change_this

# Brokers
SSO_SERVER_URL=https://your-sso-server.com/api/server
SSO_BROKER_ID=broker1|broker2
SSO_BROKER_SECRET=your_secure_broker_secret_here_change_this

# Session Security
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true
SESSION_SAME_SITE=strict
```

## Additional Security Measures

### 1. Security Headers Middleware
Created `SecurityHeaders` middleware to add:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS only)

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Consistent error responses
- Security-focused logging
- IP tracking for suspicious activities

### 3. Session Security
- Secure cookie settings
- HTTP-only cookies
- SameSite protection
- Session timeout configuration

## Deployment Recommendations

### 1. Environment Setup
- Generate strong, unique secrets for each broker
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false`
- Configure proper database credentials

### 2. Web Server Configuration
- Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- Configure proper firewall rules
- Implement reverse proxy if needed
- Set up monitoring and alerting

### 3. Monitoring
- Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Regularly review access logs
- Implement log rotation and retention policies

### 4. Regular Maintenance
- Keep Laravel and dependencies updated
- Regularly rotate SSO secrets
- Review and audit access logs
- Perform security assessments

## Testing Recommendations

Before deploying to production:
1. Test all SSO flows with the new security measures
2. Verify rate limiting works correctly
3. Test error handling scenarios
4. Validate environment variable configuration
5. Perform penetration testing on the SSO endpoints

## Breaking Changes

### For Existing Deployments:
1. **Environment Variables**: Must add SSO secret environment variables
2. **Logging**: Log format has changed for security
3. **Error Responses**: Error messages are now more generic for security
4. **Rate Limiting**: May affect legitimate high-frequency requests

### Migration Steps:
1. Update environment files with new variables
2. Generate and configure strong secrets
3. Test authentication flows
4. Update monitoring/alerting for new log formats
5. Deploy with proper HTTPS configuration

## Security Contact

For security issues, please follow responsible disclosure:
1. Do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Contact the development team privately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
