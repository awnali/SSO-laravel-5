# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

Laravel 12 SSO takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and security best practices for implementation.

## üîí Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Token-based Authentication**: Secure session tokens with cryptographic signatures
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection on all forms
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and Eloquent ORM protection
- **XSS Protection**: Output escaping and content security policies

### Encryption & Hashing

- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt with configurable cost factor
- **Token Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for session tokens
- **Secure Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random token generation
- **SSL/TLS Support**: HTTPS enforcement for production environments

### Access Control

- **Broker Authentication**: Secure broker-to-server authentication
- **Session Isolation**: Isolated sessions between different brokers
- **Automatic Logout**: Configurable session timeouts
- **Centralized Control**: Single point of authentication control

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 12.x    | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| 11.x    | ‚ùå No              |
| 10.x    | ‚ùå No              |
| < 10.0  | ‚ùå No              |

## üì¢ Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@example.com`
2. **Encrypted Email**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports
3. **Private Message**: Contact maintainers directly

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- **Environment**: PHP version, Laravel version, OS details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Report**: Vulnerability reported privately
2. **Assessment**: We assess and confirm the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Release**: Fix is released with security advisory
5. **Public Disclosure**: Details published after fix deployment

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Use strong application keys
php artisan key:generate

# Enable HTTPS in production
APP_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Use secure session configuration
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true
SESSION_SAME_SITE=strict
```

#### Database Security

```php
// Use environment variables for sensitive data
'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD'),

// Enable SSL for database connections
'mysql' => [
    'sslmode' => 'require',
    'options' => [
        PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA => '/path/to/ca-cert.pem',
    ],
],
```

#### SSO Configuration

```php
// Use strong, unique broker secrets
'brokers' => [
    'broker1' => ['secret' => env('BROKER1_SECRET')],
    'broker2' => ['secret' => env('BROKER2_SECRET')],
],

// Configure secure token expiration
'token_lifetime' => 3600, // 1 hour
'session_lifetime' => 86400, // 24 hours
```

### For System Administrators

#### Server Configuration

```nginx
# Nginx security headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

#### Firewall Rules

```bash
# Allow only necessary ports
ufw allow 80/tcp   # HTTP
ufw allow 443/tcp  # HTTPS
ufw allow 22/tcp   # SSH (restrict to specific IPs)

# Block direct access to application ports
ufw deny 8000/tcp  # SSO Server
ufw deny 8001/tcp  # Broker1
ufw deny 8002/tcp  # Broker2
```

#### SSL/TLS Configuration

```bash
# Use strong SSL ciphers
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512;
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
```

### For End Users

#### Password Security

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regularly update passwords
- Use a password manager

#### Session Security

- Always logout when finished
- Don't share login credentials
- Use trusted devices only
- Report suspicious activity

## üîç Security Auditing

### Regular Security Checks

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
composer audit

# Run security-focused tests
./run-tests.sh security

# Check file permissions
find . -type f -perm 777 -ls
```

### Monitoring

#### Log Monitoring

Monitor these log entries for security issues:

```bash
# Failed login attempts
grep "authentication failed" storage/logs/laravel.log

# Suspicious token activity
grep "invalid token" storage/logs/laravel.log

# Unauthorized access attempts
grep "unauthorized" storage/logs/laravel.log
```

#### Performance Monitoring

- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- Set up alerts for failed authentication spikes
- Track session creation/destruction rates
- Monitor database query performance

## üö® Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Breach

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Change all application keys
   - Rotate broker secrets
   - Invalidate all active sessions
   - Review access logs

2. **Investigation**
   - Preserve log files
   - Document the incident
   - Identify affected systems
   - Assess data exposure

3. **Recovery**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update configurations
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Implement additional monitoring

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Report to relevant authorities if required
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
