# Contributing to Laravel 12 SSO

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Laravel 12 SSO as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SSO-laravel-5.git
   cd SSO-laravel-5
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies for integration tests
   composer install
   
   # Install server dependencies
   cd server && composer install && cd ..
   
   # Install broker dependencies
   cd broker1 && composer install && cd ..
   cd broker2 && composer install && cd ..
   ```

3. **Setup development environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment files
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   cp broker1/.env.example broker1/.env
   cp broker2/.env.example broker2/.env
   
   # Generate application keys
   cd server && php artisan key:generate && cd ..
   cd broker1 && php artisan key:generate && cd ..
   cd broker2 && php artisan key:generate && cd ..
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   ./run-tests.sh all
   ```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Before Submitting Changes

Always run the complete test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
./run-tests.sh all

# Or run specific test types
./run-tests.sh unit
./run-tests.sh feature
./run-tests.sh integration
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods
- **Feature Tests**: Test HTTP endpoints and user interactions
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete SSO flows across applications

### Test Coverage Requirements

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for 100% test coverage on new code

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### PHP Code Standards

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add PHPDoc comments for public methods
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose

### Laravel Best Practices

- Use Laravel's built-in features when possible
- Follow Laravel naming conventions
- Use dependency injection
- Implement proper error handling

### SSO-Specific Guidelines

- Maintain security best practices
- Document any changes to authentication flow
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing brokers
- Test with multiple brokers when making changes

## üêõ Bug Reports

Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
